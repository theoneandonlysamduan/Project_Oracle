# Project_Oracle
This project has been ported to my personal account(instead of the school account). Go to https://github.com/GeneralLol/Duanaweather for updates and such.
## Objective: 
To create a piece of software that is able to pull weather information and display it through the serial port of a Raspberry Pi. 

## Setup: 
  1. Setup the Serial communication on the Raspberry Pi
  2. Connect the Serial display to the Raspberry Pi. 
  3. Download the project files into one folder. 
  4. Get into the folder directory in the terminal. 
  5. Run python3 CentralModule.py -h to see the help docs. 
 
 ## End Result: 
 The program should display date, time, weather and temperature to the display hooked up. 
 
 ## OS Support: 
 Currently this project only supports Linux. It is made and tested on Ubuntu. Other distros have not been tested. Windows will totally not work unless the pahts and command prompt commands in the python files are changed to adapt to the system. 

 ## Current Issues:
 Currently the display module is still not added, and is not worked into the Central Module yet. So dar it is only updating the weather and the time. 
 
 The Calendar Module is still work in progress.
